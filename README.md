# food-service-backend
The food service is only intended as a small tool, that provides a small webserver to vote for a restaurant and order food from said restaurant. 
You need to provide the images for the menus and configure the settings file accordingly to your use case.

This is only the backend, if you want an actual website interface you need a build of the food-service-frontend. You need to add a "dist" directory and add all files of the build frontend inside. You can find the frontend here https://github.com/ds600/food-service-frontend

You can find an example Settings file here https://github.com/ds600/food-service-backend/tree/master/Examples/Settings
